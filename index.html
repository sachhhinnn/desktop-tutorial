<h1>Project Idea </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I am passionate in innovative applications developemnt. Programming skills and knowledge will help me to achive this goal.
My project idea is to develop an mobile application. I have planned of developing an location based attendance system. </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>During my school and high school manual attendance system was time consuming and some time erroneous too. So, I have thought of mobile appliaction that will automatically take attendance based on
location. This innovative project will eliminate use of paper sheets, electronic tags, biometrics.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The project will be for android platform. The application will take the attendance on the basis of geo cordinates and IP address.
Office coordinates longitude and latitude will be  saved in the system as well as IP address of the organization's internet. Whenever students
 or employee reaches within the certain radius of the coordinate and uses organization internet, he/she will be captured as logged in and attendance will be taken</p>

<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>MySQL or SQL database will be used to keep the records.</li>
  <li>Android programming language with Eclipse will be used to write the code.</li>
  <li>Apache Tomcat will be used as server</li>
  <li>Android device will be used to test the program</li>
</ul>
